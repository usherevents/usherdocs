# My Events - Home Base

## My Events and Openings <a href="my-events-openings" id="my-events-openings"></a>

Once you have created your Opening or Event, **this is your home base**.

![My Events and Openings](../../.gitbook/assets/myevents.png)

Every current and future opening will show in the list.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can choose to Show Past Openings by selecting the slider button.
{% endhint %}

**The numbers under each item indicate the count for that item in your Opening.**

For example, under Pstn (short for Positions) the number shows 14.  That is the number of different Positions currently in your Opening.

Selecting any number or Edit link will open the detail view for that item.

Details on each item in this list are outlined in the Manage Opening section and they are linked here for your reference:
