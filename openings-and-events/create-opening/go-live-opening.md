# Go Live

Openings and Events stay in DRAFT status by default until you choose to GO LIVE.

When you are ready to make your unique URL live with your personalized home page and event details, go to My Events, select the number under Sess on the Opening or Event you are ready to make live.

Select the GO LIVE yellow button

You will be prompted to enter your Corporate code first.

If you do not have a code, select the button **I donâ€™t have code** to continue. This begins the checkout process.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For Corporate accounts and subscription accounts, your DRAFT openings and events will never expire.

For all others your DRAFT opening or event will expire, which means it will be archived and no longer editable, 6 months after your Opening Date.
