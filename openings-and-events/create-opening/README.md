# Create Opening

## Overview <a href="overview" id="overview"></a>

Openings in Usher are tailored specifically to hotels, restaurants, stores and other businesses getting ready or planning to open a new location. Openings are comprised of sessions - classes, meetings or any other activities - that people need to attend. Sessions on the schedule are filterable by Position and Category.

Here's an introduction to a few key features before we get to [creating a complete Opening](./#create-an-opening). 

### Key Features

Choosing a **primary position is required** for each session and is what determines the color coding you see on the schedule.

Position = job type.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Examples_: Front Desk, Sales Associate, Server, Housekeeping, Management
{% endhint %}

Usher ensures that everyone who needs to attend a session will see the session on their schedule when it is filtered by position. In the session add/edit screen simply include additional positions to that session.

Openings are based on an **opening date**. 

What makes this opening date different from a typical event opening date, is that it usually lands on the last day or nearly the last day of the all sessions rather than the first day. **Opening day is like launch day.** As the rocket launch counts down you see the T- numbers count down toward the launch. We do the same thing in Usher.

You set your opening date. Then each session is set at a T- (or +) number.

* 0 = Opening day (Launch day)
* \-1 = One day before opening
* \-9 = Nine days before opening
* \+1 = One day _after_ opening

Usher's T+/- feature was designed to solve time-consuming problems: 

* Scheduling changes – with the most common being Openings delayed.
* Re-doing work – having to add the same sessions over and over each time you do a new opening.

Utilizing the T+/- feature, Usher can [shift dates](../manage-opening.md#shift-dates) for the entire Opening within seconds and create templates for repeatable processes so each new opening schedule can be created very efficiently.

Now, let's go through how to create a complete opening.
