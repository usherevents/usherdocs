# Opening Set Up

## Choose Event Type <a href="create-an-opening" id="create-an-opening"></a>

From the main menu, select CREATE.

![Create an Opening or Event options](../../.gitbook/assets/create.png)

You will see three options for types of events. Choose the first option for Opening.

## Custom URL <a href="custom-url" id="custom-url"></a>

The first step is to select your custom URL.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Example_: hotelopening.usher.events
{% endhint %}

Your opening schedule and details at your custom URL will be available when you [GO LIVE](go-live-opening.md) with your Opening or Event.

Anyone with the URL will be able to visit your customized site for your Opening.

You can choose any combination of letters and numbers for your custom URL.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Usher will not let you choose any URL that has already been used.
{% endhint %}

**Choose your URL carefully. **Your custom URL is not editable after you have created your opening or event. Almost everything else can be changed later except the URL.

## Opening Name <a href="opening-date" id="opening-date"></a>

Usher puts whatever you chose for your URL as the name of your Opening. 

Change it to whatever you would like. The name can be changed anytime later in Options.

## Opening Date <a href="opening-date" id="opening-date"></a>

Select your Opening Date.

_**What if I donâ€™t know what the date will be yet?**_

The Opening date is required but can be changed as many times as you want.** **Choose an Opening Date anytime in the future.

All Events and Openings are held in [DRAFT status](../../getting-started/create-account.md#draft-status) until you choose to [GO LIVE](go-live-opening.md). This means that your schedule and information about your event are not yet shown online at your chosen URL.

**You can change your Opening date as many times as needed both before and after you **[**GO LIVE**](go-live-opening.md)**.**

## Adding Sessions <a href="adding-sessions" id="adding-sessions"></a>

There are three ways to add Sessions to your Opening or Event:

1. From a CSV file
2. From a Template
3. Individually

After selecting your Opening Date, you have the option to add sessions from a template or from a file upload or individually in a form view. 

### From CSV File <a href="from-file" id="from-file"></a>

To upload from a file, select Browse to find the .csv file that you want to use.

Below is a link for an example file which shows the fields and formatting for your upload to work properly.

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/openinguploadexample (1).csv" %}

1. Select Open to choose the file.
2. Back on the Usher screen select the yellow SAVE button.
3. Be patient as the sessions load into your new opening or event.
4. Once complete you will see a count of how many sessions were added and you can go on to the next step.

### From Template <a href="from-template" id="from-template"></a>

Any templates saved in your account will show in the drop-down list for you to choose.

Select the one you want then select SAVE.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you choose the wrong file, you can select the Discard File button and choose another file.
{% endhint %}

**Be patient as the sessions load.**

When finished Usher will show a notification that the upload was successful and automatically take you to the next step.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your file upload fails, you can discard the file and try again with another file.
{% endhint %}

### Individually <a href="individually" id="individually"></a>

Neither a Template nor File upload is required. You can add each session individually by skipping those options. 

[Individual Sessions can be added](add-opening-sessions.md) in form view once you have completed the initial create process.

## Event Details <a href="event-details" id="event-details"></a>

For your opening or event personalized site, you can add your own image, contact information and messaging.

{% hint style="info" %}
All details are optional. You can choose to scroll to the bottom of the page and select SAVE to skip adding details.
{% endhint %}

Usher features an in-screen text editor which provides editing options such as bold, italic, lists, links and images.

{% hint style="success" %}
Using the text editor, you can add as much detail as you would like about your event or opening and you can modify it anytime. Changes will be updated in real time on your event site.
{% endhint %}

To preview how the information will look on your customized home page, select the eye symbol.

Additional information with examples for using the text editor can be found in Advanced Options - [Syntax for Text Editor](../syntax-for-text-editor.md).

### Upload an Image <a href="upload-an-image" id="upload-an-image"></a>

To upload your own image for your customized home page, select Browse for Image and choose the file from your computer.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best size for your image is 900px by 1000px.
{% endhint %}

Usher will work to resize large images immediately after they are uploaded. Wait until the thumbnail view shows to see that your image has been uploaded properly.

**If you choose not to upload your own image, a default image will be used.**

{% hint style="danger" %}
When the thumbnail appears and it shows the default image instead of the image you attempted to upload, you need to resize your image to a smaller file size. 

Once you have reduced the size of your image, browse to the new file and upload it again.
{% endhint %}

### Contact Information <a href="contact-information" id="contact-information"></a>

You can list a name, phone number, email address or any combination of those on your home page for a quick way to provide help or additional information.

None are required.

### Location for the Opening <a href="location-for-the-opening" id="location-for-the-opening"></a>

Usher allows you to select a Location for your entire Opening, which is shown on the Location tab on your personalized site.

1. In the Google map search bar, enter the address of your event.
2. A list of addresses will show that Google thinks match what you want.
3. Select the correct address and the map will adjust to that location.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select CONTINUE TO SESSION REVIEW/EDIT.

_Specific locations for each session are also available in the Add/Edit Sessions views._
