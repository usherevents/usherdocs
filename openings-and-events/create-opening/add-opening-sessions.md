# Add/Edit Sessions

## Add Individual Session <a href="add-individual-session" id="add-individual-session"></a>

Once you SAVE the details for your Opening, you will land on the [Manage Sessions](../manage-opening.md#manage-sessions) screen.

![Manage Sessions](../../.gitbook/assets/managesessions.png)

From here you can add individual sessions by selecting the + button.

In the Session form view you will see all of the fields that are included in a single session.

These fields are REQUIRED:

* ID (this is required but will be filled automatically if not specified)
* Session Title
* Date or T +/-
* Start Time
* End Time
* Primary Position
* Published (defaults to Yes which means it will show on the Schedule)

Optional Fields:

* Description
* Additional Position(s)
* Categories
* Locations
* Presenters

### Session Title

Each session requires a title. The title can use any combination of letters and numbers. It does not have to be unique. If you have a _Stand-Up Meeting_ daily, that can be the title of each daily session. 

### Session ID <a href="session-id" id="session-id"></a>

The session ID must be unique. 

If you do not enter an ID (numeric only) one will be assigned.

### Session Date and T+/- <a href="session-date-and-t" id="session-date-and-t"></a>

The session date and T+/- are linked. Changing one will change the other so you do not have to worry about syncing those.

Each session is set at a T- (or +) number.

* 0 = Opening day
* \-1 = One day before opening
* \-9 = Nine days before opening
* \+1 = One day AFTER opening

![Date and T numbers are linked in form view](../../.gitbook/assets/tnumbers.png)

Note: You can also enter dates the standard way without using the T+/- and Usher will automatically set your T numbers.

### Start Time and End Time

Select the Start Time and End Time for each session using the arrows or by selecting the number and typing in the exact time.

### Primary Position <a href="primary-position" id="primary-position"></a>

The Primary Position is required and **determines the color coding** that you see on the live schedule.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/scheduleview3.png)

All positions that have been added to this Opening will be available in the drop-down menu to select.

You can add a new position to the list by selecting Add New Position.

A pop up box will show and you must enter the name of the position and choose a color for that new position.

{% hint style="success" %}
Everything is easily editable later.
{% endhint %}

### Additional Positions <a href="additional-positions" id="additional-positions"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Selecting the Primary Position and Additional Positions determines which people will see this session on their schedule when they use the schedule filters.
{% endhint %}

**Choose all positions for people who should be attending the session.**

_You do not need to select the Primary Position again in Additional Positions._

### Categories <a href="categories" id="categories"></a>

Categories provide an optional additional way to filter your schedule.

To add a new category select the Add New Category button and enter the name in the pop up box.

Each session can have multiple categories.

### Session Location <a href="session-location" id="session-location"></a>

Usher provides an option to add a specific location for each individual session.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Examples_: Conference Room B, Front Desk, Antonio's Restaurant, Main Stage
{% endhint %}

To add a new location to the list, select Add New Location. A pop up box will appear.

**The only required field is the Location Name.**

Optionally, you may add full address details.

### Presenters <a href="presenters" id="presenters"></a>

Presenters are optional.

These may include trainers or speakers or anyone presenting information for this session.

To add a new Presenter select the Add New Presenter button. A pop up box will appear.

**First Name, Last Name and Type are REQUIRED.** Email is optional.

Each session may have multiple presenters.

Note: [Presenters can be added later](../manage-opening.md#presenters) from a file and mapped to each session.
