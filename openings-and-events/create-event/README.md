# Create Event

## Overview <a href="overview" id="overview"></a>

Events in Usher can be Multiple-day or Single-day, both comprised of sessions - classes, meetings or any other activities that people need to attend. Sessions on the schedule are filterable by Track and Category.

Here's an introduction to a few key features before we get to [creating a complete Event](event-set-up.md#create-an-event). 

### Key Features

Choosing a **primary track is required** for each session and is what determines the color coding you see on the public schedule.

Tracks are commonly used for Conferences but also applicable to most types of events.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example at a Photography Conference you may have these tracks: 

* Photo Editing and Post-Production
* Lighting and Using Off-Camera Flash
* Posing Models and Portraiture
* Nature and Landscape Photography
{% endhint %}

Usher allows you to select any additional tracks that also require that session so people in those tracks will see the session on their schedules when filtered.

**Events require an Opening and Closing date** **for multi-day events or a single date for the one day events.**

Dates can change many times in the planning process.

{% hint style="success" %}
Usher has a powerful feature which allows you to reschedule your entire Event called\
[Shift Dates](../manage-event.md#shift-dates).
{% endhint %}

The SHIFT DATES feature allows you to shift the dates of all of the sessions in your event based on the Opening Date of the event.

Here is how the T+/- works:

You set your opening date. Then each session is set at a T- (or +) number.

* 0 = Opening day
* \-1 = One day before opening
* \-3 = Three days before opening
* \+1 = Day two of your event
* \+4 = Day five of your event

Note: You can also enter dates the standard way without using the T+/- and it will automatically set your T numbers.

When your event date gets pushed back, you simply select your new Opening Date and all sessions will shift to the new schedule.

Let's walk through how to create a complete event.
