# My Events - Home Base

## My Events <a href="my-events" id="my-events"></a>

Once you have created your Opening or Event, as an administrator, **this is your home base**.

![My Events and Openings](../../.gitbook/assets/myevents.png)

Every current and future opening and event will show in the list by default, divided by Opening and Event tabs.

Select the Event tab to see your Events.

You can choose to Show Past Events by selecting the slider button.

**The numbers under each item indicate the count for that item in your Event.**

For example, under Track the number shows 14.  That is the number of different Tracks currently in your Event.

Selecting any number or Edit link will open the details for that item.

Details on each item in this list are outlined in the Manage Event Section and they are linked here for your reference:
