# Printing the Schedule

### Tips for Printing the Schedule

From the Schedule Page on your customized site, select the Print icon to print the schedule.

{% hint style="info" %}
What you see is what will print, including any filtering you have done.
{% endhint %}

Depending on your printer settings, you may see a simplified view with no color bars or a black and white view with the bars shaded.

As shown in the GIF below, in your print settings, under More Settings, you can turn the color bars on by selecting Print Backgrounds.

Make sure you have Color, not Black and White, selected for Color Mode.

#### Printing a Filtered Schedule

To print the schedule for specific positions or categories, first filter the schedule online using the options in Usher. 

Then select print and you will see in the preview that only what you have selected will be printed.
