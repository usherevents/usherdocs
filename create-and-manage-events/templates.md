## What is a Template in Usher?

A template in Usher includes all of the information needed to create your Opening or Event schedule. 

For Usher that means it contains session data, including:

* IDs
* Titles
* Descriptions
* Dates or T +/- Numbers
* Start Times
* End Times
* Positions
* Categories
* Locations
* Published status

Templates do not include Presenters, Attendees or Event Admins as these are likely to change for each Opening or Event and can be easily added at any time.

## How to Create Templates <a id="create-templates"></a>

There are two ways to create templates:

* From an existing opening you have in your account
* By uploading a file of sessions

### Create a template from an existing opening or event <a id="create-a-template-from-an-existing-opening-or-event"></a>

1. Go to My Events
2. Under the heading for Sessions \(Sess\) in the row of the Event or Opening you want to create a template from, select the Sess number.
3. The next screen is the List of Sessions View.
4. Select the double paper icon.
5. A pop up will ask you to name your Template.
   * The name must be unique.
   * Spaces and numbers are allowed.
6. Select SAVE and you have now created a new template that will appear in your drop down list.

### Create a template from a file upload <a id="create-a-template-from-a-file-upload"></a>

Select your account name on the main menu, then select Manage my account, and the Templates tab.

Select the yellow Add a new Template button.

Upload your .csv file to create your template.

The format for the .csv file is the same as for creating a new opening.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/templateuploadexample \(1\).csv" %}

## Manage Templates

Templates can be deleted in Manage my account on the Templates tab.

Select Delete and confirm you want to permanently remove the template from your list.

Templates are not editable but you can download any template, make changes to it and then upload it as a new template.
