# Create Account

#### Creating an account on Usher is simple and free.

## Register <a href="register" id="register"></a>

1. From the homepage at Usher.events select CREATE AN EVENT.
2. Select Sign Up Here.
3. Enter your information then select CREATE ACCOUNT.
4. You will receive a verification email with a link to validate your registration.
5. Select or copy that link into your browser to complete the validation.
6. You can then Log In with the email provided and password you created.

## DRAFT Status <a href="draft-status" id="draft-status"></a>

Usher allows you create Openings and Events at no charge as long as they remain in DRAFT status.

{% hint style="info" %}
DRAFT status means that your personalized site is not live yet at the URL you chose when you created your Opening or Event.
{% endhint %}

While in DRAFT status, you can add and edit:

* Sessions (Schedule)
* Event Image
* Details and Information
* Locations
* Additional Administrators
* Presenters
* Color Coding and more

The documentation will step you through the process of creating an Opening or Event all the way through [going LIVE](https://app.gitbook.com/createopening.html#go-live).

## Switch to Company Name <a href="change-to-company-name" id="change-to-company-name"></a>

When you create an account, your name is automatically set as the account name. You can add your Company as a separate account.

1. Select your account name from the main menu on the top right of your screen.
2. Select Manage my account.
3. On the Profile tab you will see a text box for Company Name.
4. Enter your Company Name and select SAVE.
5. On the main menu at the top right you will see your Company Name now instead of your name.

{% hint style="info" %}
You now have two accounts - a personal account and a company account. To switch between them, select the name from main menu on the right side.
{% endhint %}

When adding administrators, be careful to add them to the correct account - typically your Company account. Also, when adding Openings or Events, be sure you are in the correct account before adding. If you accidentally add an Opening or Event to the wrong account, [contact us](https://usher.events/contact) for help.
