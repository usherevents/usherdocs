# Add Account Admins

**No need to manage everything by yourself. Share the work and empower your team!**

Account Administrators have full access to the account and all openings or events.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no limit or charge for additional Account Administrators on each account.
{% endhint %}

**To add new Account Administrators:**

1. Select your account name from the main menu on the top right of your screen.
2. Select Manage my account.
3. Go to the Account Admins tab.
4. Select the Add Admin button.
5. Enter the email address of the new Account Admin.
6. They will receive an email message with a link to Usher to create their login credentials.
7. Their email address will be immediately shown in the list of Account Admins with 'Pending invitation' shown.

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is an option to **Resend the Invitation** if the new Admin did not receive it or has any trouble with the registration process.
{% endhint %}

**Once the new Admin completes registration, they will have full Administrative rights on your account and you will see their name show in the Account Admins list, rather than 'Pending invitation'.**

Note: All Registered Users get an Usher personal account assigned to their Email address. When the registration is complete, the new Administrator will have access to both their new Personal account and the Company account. On the main menu, at the top right, they need to select the Company Name to work in the Company account.

**When adding Openings or Events, be sure you are in the correct account before adding.** If you accidentally add an Opening or Event to the wrong account, [contact us](https://usher.events/contact) for help.
