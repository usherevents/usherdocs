# Types of Events

#### Which Event type should I choose?

### **Openings**

Opening a new hotel, restaurant, store or business requires special scheduling and the flexibility to change to keep the ball moving. Openings can be planned even years in advance and preparing for a grand opening takes weeks or even months of training sessions. 

Choose Opening to create a schedule for your team and vendors that allows for shifting dates of all sessions if your opening date gets pushed.
