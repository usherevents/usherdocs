# Types of Events

#### Which Event type should I choose?

### **Openings**

Opening any new hotel, restaurant, store, or business requires special scheduling and the flexibility to change to keep the ball moving. Preparing for a grand opening takes weeks or even months of training sessions. With Usher, **Openings can be planned even years in advance** and schedule changes are quick and easy.
